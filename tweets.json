0   After learning from this product experience, we‚Äôre sharing an update: today Retweet functionality will be returning to the way it was before.\n\nHere's what we saw while we prompted Quote Tweets (1/4): https://t.co/MzoDKy3d69                                                                 
1   Our goal with prompting QTs (instead of Retweets) was to encourage more thoughtful amplification. We don‚Äôt believe that this happened, in practice. The use of Quote Tweets increased, but 45% of them included single-word affirmations and 70% had less than 25 characters. (2/4)               
2   Some of you may no longer see the ‚ÄúShare in a Fleet‚Äù option in the Tweet share menu. To get back to sharing Tweets in your Fleets, update to the latest version of the Twitter for iOS or Android app once it‚Äôs available for you.                                                                
3   This appears to be a clever scam attempt from an account with a blue verification badge masquerading as @TwitterSupport. \n\nIt links to a Google site that asks for Twitter log-in info (and password). \n\nThe handle (@satejp) used to be that of an Indian politician. https://t.co/gnh7Nc3V16

5   Every time I post something negative about the Dems, the lib minions at @Twitter remove 100 followers. We know everyone that works at @Twitter is a Democrat, but this censorship of conservative voices is un-American. @jack @TwitterSupport #censorship #freedom
